## Introduction
Climate change is a prevalent topic throughout the world. Whilst
we are all aware of the adversity that arises from such an issue,
the change is simultaneously creating opportunities elsewhere.
Traditionally the UK has not been considered a hub of Viticulture.

However, with increasing temperatures and altering weather
patterns, the UK is quickly becoming a novel producer of wines.

From Pinot Noir to a new class of English sparkling wine,
vineyards throughout the UK are shifting the long-considered
status quo for Viticulture. Throughout this website, the
untold story of the UK's viticulture is explored. From weather
patterns, to what lies beneath the grapes, you can discover how a
global phenomenon is creating change locally.
