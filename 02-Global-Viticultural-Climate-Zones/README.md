# Where grapevines will grow?

Historically, wine regions were considered to be located almost always between the latitudes of 30° and 50° [1]. As a thumb rule, along with many further characteristics of the climate and terroir, vine prefers an average temperature between 12°C and 22°C during its growing season.

With the globally changing climate, the boundaries of wine producing ranges have already moved and will be continuously moving both on the Northern as well as on the Southern hemisphere. A visible example of this is the noticeable increase in wine production in Northern European countries like the United Kingdom and Sweden.

This map shows the calculated yearly mean temperatures of the growing seasons (April to October on the Northern, October to April on the Southern hemisphere) between 1900 and 2017. Customized aggregated spatial datasets are based on information released by the NOAA [2].
