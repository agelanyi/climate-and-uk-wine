# Climate change and the UK

 Summers are getting warmer, winters are sometimes harsher, leading to more extreme conditions. The annual average temperature of the United Kingdom is increasing. Based on data from the MET Office [1], we can see that over that last 30 years, almost every year brought a higher-than-average warmth. While the change of climate is a threat to most of us, grapevine prefers this weather and can adapt to the new UK ranges. Annually, rainfall has not changed significantly over the same period of time.
