            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>A New Taste & Space for Viticulture</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-main">
              Climate change is a prevalent topic throughout the world. Whilst
              we are all aware of the adversity that arises from such an issue,
              the change is simultaneously creating opportunities elsewhere.
              Traditionally the UK has not been considered a hub of Viticulture.
              However, with increasing temperatures and altering weather
              patterns, the UK is quickly becoming a novel producer of wines.
              From Pinot Noir to a new class of English sparkling wine,
              vineyards throughout the UK are shifting the long-considered
              status quo for Viticulture. Throughout this website, the
              untold story of the UK's viticulture is explored. From weather
              patterns, to what lies beneath the grapes, you can discover how a
              global phenomenon is creating a new kind of locality.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-main">
              Historically, wine regions were located almost always between the
              latitudes of 30° and 50°. As a rule of thumb, along with many
              further characteristics of the climate and terroir, grapes prefer
              an average temperature between 12°C and 22°C throughout its
              growing season. As visualised in the next page, climates are
              changing globally. The boundaries of wine-producing ranges have
              already moved and continue to traverse throughout the Northern and
              Southern hemispheres. Domestically, the United Kingdom is
              witnessing a similar trend. The Southerly regions are increasing
              in annual temperature, becoming warmer for longer. This map shows
              the calculated yearly mean temperatures of the growing seasons
              (April to October on the Northern, October to April on the
              Southern hemisphere) between 1900 and 2017. Customized aggregated
              spatial datasets are based on information released by the NOAA
              [2].

              Summers are getting warmer, winters are sometimes harsher, leading
              to more extreme conditions. The annual average temperature of the
              United Kingdom is increasing. Based on data from the MET Office,
              we can see that over that last 30 years, almost every year brought
              a higher-than-average warmth. While the change of climate is a
              threat to most of us, grapevine prefers this weather and can adapt
              to the new UK ranges. Annually, rainfall has not changed

              Each of these graphs compare annual precipitation, sunshine 
              and temperature between the South East, and the entire UK. To 
              create a successful vineyard, grapes need a warm environment, basked in sunshine.
              When comparing the
              difference between annual average measurements in the three climate
              factors, a clear distinction is present, and increasing. The
              South-East region has a warmer environment, with more sunshine too. These differences have exacerbated throughout the 185 years, 
              exemplifying how climate change is altering weather patterns within some localities. Thus, the ideal environment for grape production is now undoubtedly 
              situated within the South East of England. <br><br>
              However, precipitation levels within the South East are consistently lower then that of the United Kingdom
              . This may present as a limiting factor in
              the success of Viticulture. Yet, in actuality,
              grapes thrive in dryer climates, such as those found within
              the traditional regions of Viticulture, within Southern Europe.<br><br>
              Ultimately, what delaminates a successful vineyard, and also
              the taste of the grapes, lies beneath the surface.

            <!-- <h3>Regional Case Study: Beneath the Vine</h3> -->
            <p class="paragraph-main">
              Vineyards grow over 30 varieties
              across the UK. Each variety requires specific levels of soil
              moisture, PH and bedrock, which can greatly alter harvest and
              taste of wine. The range for PH sits between
              5.5 and 6.8, creating equilibrium for nutrients. If the soil is
              too acidic or alkaline, yields will decrease and create unhealthy
              vines. The ideal range for soil moisture lies below 50%, as soil
              must be fertile and drain well. The bedrock beneath provides
              minerals and physical support for vineyards. But how do these
              requirements translate to a vineyard? The Rathfinny Wine
              Estate was established in 2010, the vineyard specialises in producing Pinot Noir,
              Chardonnay and Pinot Meunie, spanning 350 acres. Through
              extracting satellite data, it is evident that the surrounding land provides suitable soil moisture and PH for
              these varieties. The south-facing slopes also lie on the same
              chalk as the Paris Basin. Chalk provides a
              soft, yet cooling and porous alkaline bedrock, ideal for grapes
              for high acidity.

              shown, upon the 10th of October 2017, displays both the smoke from
              the event, but, more importantly, the damage. With the
              Near-Infrared Image on the right, areas that display as black have
              been burned. Such events are increasing in frequency, alongside
              other natural events. This is not an isolated incident, nor is it
              temporally restricted. Globally, climate change is altering
              patterns of production and consumption. Whilst the expanding
              Viticulture within the UK may be considered a benefit, the
              environmental cost of such a delicacy is high.

            <p class="paragraph-main">
              Throughout this narrative, we have explored the UK’s burgeoning
              Viticulture. From what is being produced, to how and why it is
              clear that the change in climate has driven this opportunity.
              However, with the point of no return, in which the potential to
              un-do climate change will become impassable, we should begin to question
              whether the chance to enjoy a locally sourced wine is truly a
              permanent choice we want.
